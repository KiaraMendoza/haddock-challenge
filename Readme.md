# This is a code challenge made for Haddock.

The instructions of the challenge are on the "instructions.md" file.

## Running the project

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Run the project

```bash
  npm run start
```

Follow the instructions on console

//TODO: Add tests, and be able to run them with "npm run test".

## About the project

I have made this project with node and typescript trying to follow the instructions example.

To configure new products or discounts, please, edit the json files on /src/config.

This project should serve as an example of how to handle the requirements specified on the instructions file, but on a real project I would have used react (or at least a basic front-end) instead of just the console to add/remove products from the cart and interact with the data.
